    <p>Crock Pot Spaghetti and Meatballs is an all-in-one meal! Perfect for a buffet-style meal or potluck! So easy and only a handful of ingredients!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
<li>24 ounce jar spaghetti sauce</li>
<li>20 ounce bag frozen meatballs</li>
<li>4 cups water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried basil </li>
<li>Â½ (16 ounce) box spaghetti noodles</li>
<li>2-3 Tablespoons olive oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a 6-quart oval slow cooker, pour in half the jarred spaghetti sauce and do your best to spread it around evenly.</li>
        <li>Layer the frozen meatballs in a single layer (as best as possible) on top of spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the spaghetti sauce over the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Then pour in 4 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and basil on top. No need to stir.</li>
        <li>Finally, layer the spaghetti noodles on top and evenly drizzle the spaghetti noodles with 2-3 tablespoon olive oil to lightly coat.</li>
        <li>Then, gently push down the spaghetti noodles until they are under the water (breaking them if necessary to fit.)</li>
        <li>Try to make sure each noodle is coated in the sauce. This will help to keep the noodles from sticking together while cooking.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on low for about 2.5 hours (until noodles are soft and meatballs are heated through).</li>
        <li>About halfway through, gently stir the noodles with a pasta fork to make sure none of the noodles are sticking together.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti is ready when the noodles are al dente and most of the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
